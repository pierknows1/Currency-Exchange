Currency Exchangeis a wesbsite that takes different currencies and converts them the other 5 available. With the selected data it makes an API call to get the most recent conversion.

## **Complete Setup**

* Clone this repository

* Go to the ExchangeRate-API website to register for a free API key: ExchangeRate-API


* Add your API key to the .env file by entering the line API_KEY={xxx} where the {xxx} should be replaced with your private key. Be sure to follow this exact naming convention, including capitalization, then save the file.

* Open the project in VS Code
* Run the following commands in the terminal to install packages with npm: $ npm install $ npm run build $ 
* Open the browser and type http://localhost:8080/


## **Known Bugs**

The only bug I can see is that npm start does not open the browser, please load http://localhost:8080/ after doing "npm start".
